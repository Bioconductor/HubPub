Description: HubPub provides users with functionality to help with the 
    Bioconductor Hub structures. The package provides the ability to create a 
    skeleton of a Hub style package that the user can then populate with the 
    necessary information. There are also functions to help add resources to 
    the Hub package metadata files as well as publish data to the Bioconductor 
    S3 bucket.
